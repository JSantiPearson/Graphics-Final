# White Face
## My horrifying graphics final

White Face is a game I designed and developed in a month for my graphics course. It was written entirely in HTML, CSS, and JavaScript and utilized the JS library "Three.js". 

You find yourself in a dark, creepy parking garage. Your car won't start, and the gate leading outside is locked. Can you find the key and escape before whatever is lurking in the shadows catches up to you?

The game recieved an A, and I feel that it could be made even better given more time. I hope to work on it more in the future.

## How to install:

1. Clone the repository onto your local machine.
2. Install npm and node.
3. Via the command line, enter this command: npm install http-server -g
4. Navigate to the project folder and enter this: http-server
5. Open Microsoft Edge (I know, I know. Yet somehow it works best on this browser than on Chrome or Firefox.)
6. Enter http://127.0.0.1:8080 or localhost:8080 into your url bar.
7. Click on White Face.
8. Give the game a second or two to load, then enjoy!

For testing and demonstration purposes, I have disabled the death state. If the monster catches up to you, you'll be just fine. :)

## Controls:

W - Forward
S - Backward
